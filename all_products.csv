The AudioQuest Golden Gate 3.5mm to RCA Cable (4.9') is designed to reduce distortion in your signal. To achieve this the audio cable utilizes solid perfect-surface copper conductors in a double-balanced asymmetrical geometry with foamed-polyethylene insulation, a metal-layer noise dissipation system, and cold-welded gold-plated RCA plugs.
The solid perfect-surface copper conductors have less oxides, less impurities, and less grain boundaries than industry standard oxygen-free high conductivity copper, which reduces the amount of magnetic and electrical interference within the cable. The double-balanced asymmetrical geometry lowers the impedance on the ground plane and improves the dynamic response of the signal. The foamed-polyethylene insulation creates an air insulator around the conductors which significantly reduces the absorption of energy and presence of distortion in the cable. The metal-layer noise-dissipation system blocks RF interference from entering the ground plane of the cable. The use of cold-weld connections ensures that the joints between the cable and hardware have a reduced influence on signal clarity. The gold-plated RCA plugs will not oxidize, tarnish, or corrode the same way other metals can. All of these features combine to provide you with an audio cable with reduced distortion.

Solid Long-Grain Copper Conductors for Clarity
The AudioQuest Evergreen RCA-RCA Cable is crafted with solid Long-Grain Copper conductors, which have fewer oxides, impurities, and grain boundaries compared to standard copper. This superior construction reduces magnetic and electrical interference within the cable, ensuring a clearer and more precise audio signal transmission.
Foamed-Polyethylene Insulation for Reduced Distortion
To further enhance the audio signal integrity, the Evergreen cable utilizes foamed-polyethylene insulation. This creates an air insulator around the conductors, significantly reducing energy absorption and distortion in the cable. The result is a more accurate and faithful reproduction of your music.
Metal-Layer Noise-Dissipation System for RF Interference Blockage
The Evergreen cable features a metal-layer noise-dissipation system that effectively blocks RF interference from entering the ground plane of the cable. This ensures that your audio signal remains free from external noise, providing a cleaner and more enjoyable listening experience.
Double-Balanced Asymmetrical Geometry for Improved Dynamics
The double-balanced asymmetrical geometry of the Evergreen cable lowers the impedance on the ground plane and improves the dynamic response of the signal. This geometry enhances the overall audio performance, delivering a more lively and engaging sound.
High-Pressure Cold-Welded Connections for Signal Integrity
AudioQuest's high-pressure cold-welded connections are used in the Evergreen cable to ensure that the joints between the cable and hardware do not degrade the signal clarity. This meticulous construction technique preserves the integrity of the audio signal from source to output.
Gold-Plated RCA Plugs for Optimal Conductance
The RCA plugs of the Evergreen cable are gold-plated to improve electrical conductance and ensure a stable connection. Gold's resistance to oxidation, tarnishing, and corrosion means that the plugs will maintain their quality and performance over time.
Designed for the Audiophile
The AudioQuest Evergreen RCA-RCA Cable is designed with the audiophile in mind. Every aspect of its construction, from the materials used to the geometric design, is aimed at delivering the highest quality audio experience. Whether you're connecting your stereo system, home theater, or other audio components, the Evergreen cable is engineered to elevate your listening experience.

E5AJbuTajbv7O6i4rY3hnp,"","AudioQuest","/accessories/audio-cables","SOLID LONG-GRAIN COPPER (LGC) CONDUCTORS Solid Long-Grain Copper (LGC) allows a smoother and clearer sound than cables using regular OFHC (Oxygen-Free High-Conductivity) copper. Solid conductors prevent strand interaction, a major source of distortion. The surface quality is critical because a conductor can be considered as a rail-guide for both the electric fields within a conductor, and for the magnetic fields outside the conductor. LGC has fewer oxides within the conducting material, less impurities, less grain boundaries, and definitively better performance. HARD-CELL FOAM INSULATION Hard-Cell Foam (HCF) Insulation ensures critical signal-pair geometry. Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy. Some of this energy is stored and then released as distortion. Hard-Cell Foam Insulation is similar to the Foamed-PE used in our more affordable Bridges & Falls cables, and is nitrogen-injected to create air pockets. Because nitrogen (like air) does not absorb energy and therefore does not release any energy from or into the conductor, distortion is reduced. In addition, the stiffness of the material allows the cable's conductors to maintain a stable relationship along the cable's full length, producing a stable impedance character and further minimizing distortion. METAL-LAYER NOISE-DISSIPATION SYSTEM It's easy to accomplish 100% shield coverage. Preventing captured Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from modulating the equipment's ground reference requires AQ's Noise-Dissipation System (NDS). Traditional shield systems typically absorb and then drain noise/RF energy to component ground, modulating and distorting the critical ""reference"" ground plane, which in turn causes a distortion of the signal. NDS ""shields the shield,"" absorbing and reflecting most of this noise/RF energy before it reaches the layer attached to ground. DOUBLE-BALANCED GEOMETRY Specifically designed for single-ended applications, Double-Balanced Geometry offers a relatively lower impedance on the ground for a richer and more dynamic experience. While many single-ended cable designs use a single path for both the ground and the shield, Double-Balanced designs separate the two for cleaner, quieter performance. COLD-WELDED, GOLD-PLATED TERMINATIONS This plug design allows for a connection devoid of solder, which is a common source of distortion. Instead of solder, the process employs a high-pressure technique. Because the ground shells are stamped instead of machined, the metal used can be chosen for low distortion instead of machinability.",""

ZERO CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCE
While many AC power cables feature low DC resistance in order to accommodate the demand for high current, a cable’s characteristic impedance is also crucial for optimal performance. Unlike most AC cables that constrict or compress an audio-provoked transient, AudioQuest AC cables combine low DC resistance and zero (no) characteristic impedance in order to deliver uncompressed transients on demand.

The AudioQuest NRG-X2 US 2-prong Power Cable is designed to reduce distortion in your signal chain. To achieve this the power cord utilizes long-grain copper in a helical array geometry with cold-weld connections. The long-grain copper has less oxides, less impurities, and less grain boundaries than industry standard oxygen-free high conductivity copper, which reduces the amount of interference within the cable. The geometry of the design influences the basic electrical properties of the cable, such as inductance and conductance. The use of cold-weld connections insures that the joints between the cable and hardware have a reduced influence influence on the signal clarity.


 



Cold-Weld System

Instead of traditional hot solder connections, the cables utilize a high pressure point of contact connection with copper or silver-impregnated paste, which maintains the structural integrity of the cable with a reduced influence on the signal clarity





Geometry

The cable utilizes a helical-array geometry, wherein the conductors spiral around one another which provides significantly better clarity and dynamic contrast than if the conductors are wrapped in multiple twisted pairs or run in parallel





Conductors

The power cable utilizes semi-solid concentric packed long-grain copper (LGC) conductors which reduce distortion by having larger strands that do not change position along the length of the cable and have fewer oxides, less grain boundaries, and less impurities than industry standard oxygen-free high conductivity copper
