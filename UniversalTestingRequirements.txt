# Universal Testing Requirements

## Mandatory Setup

- Clean state between tests: `afterEach(() => { /* reset stores, clear localStorage, etc. */ })`
- Use correct import syntax for the actual codebase version
- Handle async operations with proper awaits/acts
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, localStorage, etc.)

## Test Hygiene

- Each test runs independently
- No shared test data between tests
- Descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- One assertion per logical behavior

## Critical Rule

- **Don't test external libraries** - Test your business logic, not if Zustand/React/etc work
- Test user behaviors and edge cases, not library functionality
