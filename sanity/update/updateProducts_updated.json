Solid silver-plated conductors are excellent for very high-frequency applications, like USB audio. These signals, being such a high frequency, travel almost exclusively on the surface of the conductor. As the surface is made of high-purity silver, the performance is very close to that of a solid silver cable, but priced much closer to solid copper cable. This is an incredibly cost effective way of manufacturing very high-quality USB cables.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Solid High-Density Polyethylene Insulation :</h3>\n<p>Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then later released as distortion. Solid High-Density Polyethylene Insulation ensures critical signal-pair geometry while minimizing insulation-induced phase distortion.</p>\n<h3>Gold-Plated Terminations :</h3>\n<p>Precision gold-plated plugs are carefully attached with the very best solder. Through choice of flux and metallurgy, AQ solder has been optimized to make a low-distortion connection. The difference you hear between solders is a result of connection quality. AQ solder does not have a high silver content because the more silver there is in solder, the more difficult it is to make a good connection.</p>\n<h3>Universal Serial Bus Device Class Definition for Audio Devices :</h3>\n<p>USB (Universal Serial BUS) was established by a stalwart group of companies such as Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft (just to name a few) in order to give the personal computing world a truly universal standard and means to connect devices such as hard drives, printers, cameras, and, more importantly to us, audio components. Included in the original description are protocols for the pristine transfer of audio over USB. Great care and sensitivity went into this. Consequently, a computer connected to a USB-enabled digital-to-analog converter can outperform the best compact disc players available today. AudioQuest is committed to contributing products that honor USB's ability to deliver state-of-the-art performance on this new and wonderful frontier.</p>\n<p><i>*Headphones.com is very pleased to announce that you have even more options to pay for your AudioQuest USB cables! Now when you hit the Pay with Crypto button, you have the option to pay with currencies such as <strong>NANO, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum</strong> and more! We are very excited to able to give you these options now and for the future!*</i></p>\n        "

To achieve this the audio cable utilizes solid long-grain copper conductors in a double-balanced asymmetrical geometry with foamed-polyethylene insulation, a metal-layer noise dissipation system, and cold-welded gold-plated RCA plugs.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The solid long-grain copper conductors have less oxides, less impurities, and less grain boundaries than industry standard oxygen-free high conductivity copper, which reduces the amount of magnetic and electrical interference within the cable. The double-balanced asymmetrical geometry lowers the impedance on the ground plane and improves the dynamic response of the signal. The foamed-polyethylene insulation creates an air insulator around the conductors which significantly reduces the absorption of energy and presence of distortion in the cable. The metal-layer noise-dissipation system blocks RF interference from entering the ground plane of the cable. The use of cold-weld connections ensures that the joints between the cable and hardware have a reduced influence on signal clarity. The gold-plated RCA plugs will not oxidize, tarnish, or corrode the same way other metals can. All of these features combine to provide you with an audio cable with reduced distortion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<h2 class=\"h2_3mKLQXta2yzqy1x1OMWtpo\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Solid Long-Grain Copper Conductors</h2>\n<div class=\"description_2DgPuikwv5WtH_I_CNSiB2\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"js-injected-html\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The solid long-grain copper conductors have less oxides, less impurities, and less grain boundaries than industry standard oxygen-free high conductivity copper and therefore causes less magnetic and electrical interference within the cable</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<h2 class=\"h2_3mKLQXta2yzqy1x1OMWtpo\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<br>Foamed-Polyethylene Insulation</h2>\n<div class=\"description_2DgPuikwv5WtH_I_CNSiB2\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"js-injected-html\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The foamed-polyethylene insulation creates an air insulator around the conductors which significantly reduces the absorption of energy and presence of distortion in the cable</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<h2 class=\"h2_3mKLQXta2yzqy1x1OMWtpo\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<br>Metal-Layer Noise-Dissipation System (NDS)</h2>\n<div class=\"description_2DgPuikwv5WtH_I_CNSiB2\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"js-injected-html\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The metal-layer noise-dissipation system blocks RF interference from entering the ground plane of the cable</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<h2 class=\"h2_3mKLQXta2yzqy1x1OMWtpo\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<br>Double-Balanced Asymmetrical Geometry</h2>\n<div class=\"description_2DgPuikwv5WtH_I_CNSiB2\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"js-injected-html\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The double-balanced asymmetrical geometry of the cable lowers the impedance on the ground plane and improves the dynamic response of the signal</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<h2 class=\"h2_3mKLQXta2yzqy1x1OMWtpo\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<br>Cold-Weld</h2>\n<div class=\"description_2DgPuikwv5WtH_I_CNSiB2\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"js-injected-html\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Unlike traditional hot solder joints, the cable uses high pressure cold-weld connections</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<h2 class=\"h2_3mKLQXta2yzqy1x1OMWtpo\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<br>Gold-Plated RCA</h2>\n<div class=\"description_2DgPuikwv5WtH_I_CNSiB2\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<div class=\"js-injected-html\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The gold-plated RCA plugs will not oxidize, tarnish, or corrode the same way other metals can</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n        "

Solid silver-plated conductors are excellent for very high-frequency applications, like USB audio. These signals, being such a high frequency, travel almost exclusively on the surface of the conductor. As the surface is made of high-purity silver, the performance is very close to that of a solid silver cable, but priced much closer to solid copper cable. This is an incredibly cost effective way of manufacturing very high-quality USB cables.</p>\n<h3>Solid High-Density Polyethylene Insulation :</h3>\n<p>Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then later released as distortion. Solid High-Density Polyethylene Insulation ensures critical signal-pair geometry while minimizing insulation-induced phase distortion.</p>\n<h3>Carbon-Based 3-Layer Noise Dissipation System (NDS)</h3>\n<p>100% shield coverage is easy. Preventing captured RF Interference from modulating the equipment’s ground reference requires AQ’s Noise-Dissipation System. Metal and Carbon-Loaded synthetics prevent most RFI from reaching the equipment’s ground plane.</p>\n<h3>Silver-Plated Terminations :</h3>\n<p>Precision direct-silver plated pins are carefully attached with the very best solder. Through choice of flux and metallurgy, AQ solder has been optimized to make a low-distortion connection. The difference you hear between solders is a result of connection quality. AQ Solder does not have a high silver content because the more silver there is in solder, the more difficult it is to make a good connection.</p>\n<h3>Universal Serial Bus Device Class Definition for Audio Devices :</h3>\n<p>USB (Universal Serial BUS) was established by a stalwart group of companies such as Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft (just to name a few) in order to give the personal computing world a truly universal standard and means to connect devices such as hard drives, printers, cameras, and, more importantly to us, audio components. Included in the original description are protocols for the pristine transfer of audio over USB. Great care and sensitivity went into this. Consequently, a computer connected to a USB-enabled digital-to-analog converter can outperform the best compact disc players available today. AudioQuest is committed to contributing products that honor USB's ability to deliver state-of-the-art performance on this new and wonderful frontier.</p>\n<p><i>*Headphones.com is very pleased to announce that you have even more options to pay for your AudioQuest USB cables! Now when you hit the Pay with Crypto button, you have the option to pay with currencies such as <strong>NANO, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum</strong> and more! We are very excited to able to give you these options now and for the future!*</i></p>\n        "

First up in the line-up is the <strong>AudioQuest Pearl</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>AudioQuest Pearl Digital Audio USB Cable</strong> has solid conductors that eliminate strand-interaction distortion. The Pearl's solid Long-Grain Copper allows a smoother and clearer sound than cables using regular OFHC (Oxygen-Free High-Conductivity) copper. OFHC is a general metal industry specification regarding loss without any concern for distortion. LGC has fewer oxides within the conducting material, less impurities, less grain boundaries, and definitively better performance.</p>\n<h4>FOAMED-POLYETHYLENE INSULATION:</h4>\n<p>Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then released as distortion. Pearl USB uses air-filled Foamed-Polyethylene Insulation because air absorbs next to no energy and Polyethylene is low-loss and has a benign distortion profile. Thanks to all the air in Foamed-PE, it causes much less of the out-of-focus effect common to other materials.</p>\n<h4>TERMINATIONS:</h4>\n<p>Precision gold-plated plugs are carefully attached with the very best solder. Through choice of flux and metallurgy, AudioQuest solder has been optimized to make a low-distortion connection. The difference you hear between solders is a result of connection quality. AudioQuest solder does not have a high silver content because the more silver there is in solder, the more difficult it is to make a good connection.</p>\n<h4>UNIVERSAL SERIAL BUS DEVICE CLASS DEFINITION FOR AUDIO DEVICES:</h4>\n<p>USB (Universal Serial BUS) was established by a stalwart group of companies such as Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft (just to name a few) in order to give the personal computing world a truly universal standard and means to connect devices such as hard drives, printers, cameras, and, more importantly to us, audio components.

To achieve this the audio cable utilizes solid perfect-surface copper conductors in a double-balanced asymmetrical geometry with foamed-polyethylene insulation, a metal-layer noise dissipation system, and cold-welded gold-plated RCA plugs.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The solid perfect-surface copper conductors have less oxides, less impurities, and less grain boundaries than industry standard oxygen-free high conductivity copper, which reduces the amount of magnetic and electrical interference within the cable. The double-balanced asymmetrical geometry lowers the impedance on the ground plane and improves the dynamic response of the signal. The foamed-polyethylene insulation creates an air insulator around the conductors which significantly reduces the absorption of energy and presence of distortion in the cable. The metal-layer noise-dissipation system blocks RF interference from entering the ground plane of the cable. The use of cold-weld connections ensures that the joints between the cable and hardware have a reduced influence on signal clarity. The gold-plated RCA plugs will not oxidize, tarnish, or corrode the same way other metals can.

            "text": "\n          <p>The audio frontier is all abuzz these days with the pleasure possible though HDMI, USB, FireWire® and Ethernet connections. However, these current generation digital technologies are only part of the story, just as the challenge of designing, manufacturing and choosing the best analog interconnects and speaker cables is as important as ever. The S/P-DIF (Sony® Philips Digital InterFace), which arrived in 1983 along with the CD, is still very much a part of our world today. S/P-DIF is transmitted through Digital Coax and Toslink fiber optics (EIA-J), making them still some of the most important cables in electronic entertainment.</p>\n<p>While, thanks to HDMI, Toslink is not so often used to connect a DVD player to an A/V receiver, Toslink connectors are common on cable-boxes, TV sets, subwoofers, all sorts of products. And now, the 3.5mm Mini Optical connector, also somewhat incorrectly known as Mini-Toslink, is everywhere … from the 3.5mm dual-purpose headphone jack on a Mac laptop, to inputs on some of the finest portables.</p>\n<p>For these many reasons, AudioQuest has refined and renewed our line of serious high performance OptiLink cables. All models and all lengths are now available Toslink to Toslink and Toslink to 3.5mm Mini Optical. When the question is “how can a fiber-optic cable change the sound?” … the answer is easier to explain than for almost any other type of cable. If the light source were a coherent laser, firing into a vacuum, all the light would stay straight, arriving at its destination at the same time. Even if the LED light source in a Toslink system were coherent, the light entering a fiber-optic cable is scattered and dispersed by imperfections and impurities in the fiber. This can be measured as a loss of amplitude … but amplitude is not the problem, a 50% true loss would have no effect on sound quality.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the dispersed light does get through the cable, but only after it has taken a longer path, like a pool ball bouncing off the side-rails, causing it to arrive later. This delayed part of the signal prevents the computer charged with decoding this information from being able to decode properly, or even at all. The inability to decode shows first at higher frequencies (not audio frequencies, this is a mono stream of digital audio information), so reduced bandwidth is a measurable signature of light being dispersed by a fiber. The punch line: The less dispersion in the fiber, the less distortion in the final analog audio signal presented to our ears.</p>\n<p>There is another serious dispersal mechanism in the Toslink system. The fiber is a relatively huge 1.0mm in diameter, and the LED light source is also relatively large, spraying light into the fiber at many different angles. Even if the fiber were absolutely perfect, the signal would be spread across time because light rays entering at different angles take different length paths and arrives with different amounts of delay.</p>\n<p>The almost complete solution to this problem is to use hundreds of much smaller fibers in a 1.0mm bundle. Because each fiber is limited as to what angle of input can enter the fiber, there is far less variety, and far less dispersion over time. This narrow-aperture effect is similar to how a pin-hole camera can take a picture without a lens … by letting in light at only a very limited range of angles, a picture can be taken, whereas removing the lens from a wider aperture would make photography impossible. Less light gets through a multi-fiber cable, but the light that does get into the fibers comes out within in a much smaller time-envelope.</p>\n<p>So there is one problem, the dispersion of light across time … and two avenues towards a better result: less dispersion in the fiber (better polymers and ultimately quartz), and less dispersion by filtering the input angle. How simple is that! Listen and enjoy.</p>\n<p><i>*Headphones.com is very pleased to announce that you have even more options to pay for your AudioQuest Optical cables!

Solid conductors prevent strand interaction, a major source of distortion. The surface quality is critical because a conductor can be considered as a rail-guide for both the electric fields within a conductor, and for the magnetic fields outside the conductor. LGC has fewer oxides within the conducting material, less impurities, less grain boundaries, and definitively better performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>HARD-CELL FOAM INSULATION</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Hard-Cell Foam (HCF) Insulation ensures critical signal-pair geometry. Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy. Some of this energy is stored and then released as distortion. Hard-Cell Foam Insulation is similar to the Foamed-PE used in our more affordable Bridges &amp; Falls cables, and is nitrogen-injected to create air pockets. Because nitrogen (like air) does not absorb energy and therefore does not release any energy from or into the conductor, distortion is reduced. In addition, the stiffness of the material allows the cable's conductors to maintain a stable relationship along the cable's full length, producing a stable impedance character and further minimizing distortion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>METAL-LAYER NOISE-DISSIPATION SYSTEM</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>It's easy to accomplish 100% shield coverage. Preventing captured Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from modulating the equipment's ground reference requires AQ's Noise-Dissipation System (NDS). Traditional shield systems typically absorb and then drain noise/RF energy to component ground, modulating and distorting the critical \"reference\" ground plane, which in turn causes a distortion of the signal. NDS \"shields the shield,\" absorbing and reflecting most of this noise/RF energy before it reaches the layer attached to ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>DOUBLE-BALANCED GEOMETRY</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Specifically designed for single-ended applications, Double-Balanced Geometry offers a relatively lower impedance on the ground for a richer and more dynamic experience. While many single-ended cable designs use a single path for both the ground and the shield, Double-Balanced designs separate the two for cleaner, quieter performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>COLD-WELDED, GOLD-PLATED TERMINATIONS</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n<li>This plug design allows for a connection devoid of solder, which is a common source of distortion. Instead of solder, the process employs a high-pressure technique. Because the ground shells are stamped instead of machined, the metal used can be chosen for low distortion instead of machinability.</li>\n</ul>\n        "
