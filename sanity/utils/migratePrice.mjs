/**
 * This script migrates data from the old 'price' field to the new 'displayPrice' field
 * for all documents of type 'product'.
 *
 * It is designed to be run from the command line.
 *
 * --- HOW TO USE ---
 *
 * 1. Dry Run (Recommended First):
 * Run this command to see which products will be changed, without actually changing them.
 * $ node ./sanity/utils/migratePrice.mjs --dry-run
 *
 * 2. Real Migration:
 * After confirming the dry run looks correct, run this command to perform the migration.
 * $ node ./sanity/utils/migratePrice.mjs
