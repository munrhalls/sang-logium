            "text": "Our Take: The Focal Clear will bring you 5% short of Utopia. Meaning the Focal Clear is about 95% of its bigger brother, the Focal Utopia. The Clear has some of the best detail, resolution and dynamics in its price range however if you are looking for a little more low-end we recommend looking elsewhere as the Clear does have a brighter sound signature.\nHeadphones.com has partnered with Focal to secure exclusive rights to Focal's last manufacturing run of the Focal Clear. The Focal Clear is now discontinued and only available for $890 (SAVE $600!) from Headphones.com! As it is the last manufacturing run and a Final Sale item, the Focal Clear is final sale and cannot be returned. However, the Clear is fully covered under Focal's manufacturer warranty."

Headphones with higher sensitivity ratings will produce louder sounds than headphones with lower sensitivity ratings. It is measured in dB SPL (decibels of sound pressure level) per unit of power (typically 1 milliWatt) or sometimes unit of voltage (typically 1 Volt) from the source at a frequency of 1 kHz."

        "information": "When driving headphones at high volumes, it is possible for the diaphragm (the ‘speaker’ inside the headphones) to be unable to move fast enough. This leads to distortion, manifesting itself as crackling, popping or the alteration of musical notes. Most headphones will fall below 1% THD."

        "information": "Headphone frequency response refers to the frequency-specific sensitivity of the output. Frequency responses show the range that headphones are capable of reproducing—a graph shows which frequencies are accentuated over others. The ideal range covers the audible sound range of 20 Hz – 20 kHz."
