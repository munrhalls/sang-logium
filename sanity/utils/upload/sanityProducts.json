Lightweight and comfortable, the Arya are easy to leave on your head all day while you're at the office or at home listening to music. With a recent price drop from $1599 to $1299, the Hifiman Arya Planar Magnetic Headphones will not disappoint."

Fast, wide soundstage and mind-blowing detail make the Arya a must-listen. HifiMan Arya features a driver based on the HE1000 V2 headphones, one of the best drivers on the market in our opinion, which raises the sonic characteristics to a considerably higher level than similarly priced products."

Made with studio engineers in mind, the LCD-X targets a neutral sound with a touch of warmth resulting in a more laid-back listen than what you would get from something like the Focal Clear or Hifiman Arya. However, the LCD-X does weigh 612 grams so comfort can be an issue for some."
