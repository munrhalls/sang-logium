    "description": "Our Take: The Focal Clear will bring you 5% short of Utopia. Meaning the Focal Clear is about 95% of its bigger brother, the Focal Utopia. The Clear has some of the best detail, resolution and dynamics in its price range however if you are looking for a little more low-end we recommend looking elsewhere as the Clear does have a brighter sound signature.\nHeadphones.com has partnered with Focal to secure exclusive rights to Focal's last manufacturing run of the Focal Clear. The Focal Clear is now discontinued and only available for $890 (SAVE $600!) from Headphones.com! As it is the last manufacturing run and a Final Sale item, the Focal Clear is final sale and cannot be returned. However, the Clear is fully covered under Focal's manufacturer warranty.",
