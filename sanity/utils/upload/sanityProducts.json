Lightweight and comfortable, the Arya are easy to leave on your head all day while you're at the office or at home listening to music. With a recent price drop from $1599 to $1299, the Hifiman Arya Planar Magnetic Headphones will not disappoint."

Fast, wide soundstage and mind-blowing detail make the Arya a must-listen. HifiMan Arya features a driver based on the HE1000 V2 headphones, one of the best drivers on the market in our opinion, which raises the sonic characteristics to a considerably higher level than similarly priced products."

Gone is the mid-range dip and uncomfortable pads. The Clear has excellent bass extension, clear, detailed mids and highs that truly stand out.

Made with studio engineers in mind, the LCD-X targets a neutral sound with a touch of warmth resulting in a more laid-back listen than what you would get from something like the Focal Clear or Hifiman Arya. However, the LCD-X does weigh 612 grams so comfort can be an issue for some."

Not only does the concave glass help reduce outside noise, it also acts as a resonance reducer by reflecting sound to a dedicated absorber. You can also see through the glass and see the inner-workings of the HD 820 which is an absolutely gorgeous pair of cans. Because of the concave glass, the closed-back design of the HD 820 makes it one of the most versatile high-end headphones on the market. Whether you are using them for musical enjoyment, mixing and mastering or on the go, the HD 820 are flexible to your needs."

They have a natural sound with some coloured bass that gives them a truly addictive sound. The 99 Classics are seriously hard to put down and have become office favourites at headphones.com. The immaculate design of the 99 Classics really make them pop as well, making heads turn as soon as you walk into a room.There is a trend in the high-end headphone industry to make headphones looking luxurious while the sound quality does not match the price point. The 99 Classics not only look amazing, they sound far and above how they should at their price point. If you like headphones with a clean, detailed natural sound and punchy bass that isn’t over the top these are the headphones for you."

The Audivina relies on Hifiman’s renowned Stealth Magnets technology to enable sound waves to pass through the magnets without generating interference. The design is featured on their flagship headphone for a reason because of the fidelity and clarity that only Stealth Magnets can achieve. The Audivina features acoustical architecture based on the finest concert halls in Europe: The Beyreuth Festival Theater in Germany."
