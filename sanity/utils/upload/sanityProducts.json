The Clear has some of the best detail, resolution and dynamics in its price range however if you are looking for a little more low-end we recommend looking elsewhere as the Clear does have a brighter sound signature."

Headphones with higher sensitivity ratings will produce louder sounds than headphones with lower sensitivity ratings.

        "information": "When driving headphones at high volumes, it is possible for the diaphragm (the ‘speaker’ inside the headphones) to be unable to move fast enough. This leads to distortion, manifesting itself as crackling, popping or the alteration of musical notes. Most headphones will fall below 1% THD."

Frequency responses show the range that headphones are capable of reproducing—a graph shows which frequencies are accentuated over others.
