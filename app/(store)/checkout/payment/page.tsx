// REQUIREMENTS
// - user selects a method, pays, payment goes through via stripe, customer id is saved here, if customer is logged & checked checkbox then the customer id is saved to sanity cms to his user doc and only customer id
// - if customer comes back his default payment method is retrieved from stripe and used to auto-fill, along with all his other methods - if he doesn't have any methods, he can add them - and he can change the default payment method - all of this is done via requests to stripe and is stored on stripe only - sanity cms (my whole app) - only has access to stripe customer id, nothing else

// BIG CODE CHUNKS
// 1 HANDLE LOGGED IN VS GUEST
// - if !auth skip adding client stripe id and their payments methods and default payment method to clientSecret; else request customer id payment meyhods and default payment method from stripe and add them to clientSecret
// 2 SETUP STRIPE ACCORDINGLY
// - payment intent create:
// - if guest, normal payment intent create
// - setup, if stripe customer id - also pass customer id payment methods and default payment, so it ends up in the resulting client secret
// - else, if logged in - pass what's needed to create stripe customer id + enable saving payment methods
// 3 FRONTEND STRIPE COMPS & INITIALIZE
// - payments page - return CheckoutForm top lvl comp, it takes clientSecret props
// - inside CheckoutForm - return Elements top lvl provider which takes both clientSecret BUT ALSO stripePromise from loadStripe
// - enable PAYMENT METHOD SELECTION + FILL + SEND PAYMENT
// 4 HANDLE AFTER PAYMENT
// - GUEST? JUST PROCESS PAYMENT NORMALLY // IF HE CLICKS SIGN UP FROM /REVIEW PAGE -> CREATE HIS CLERK ACC -> THEN USE THAT TO CR8 CUSTOMER STRIPE ID -> ADD THAT PAYMENT'S DATA METHOD TO HIS LIST & MAKE DEFAULT -> DISPLAY CONFIRMATION TOAST
// - IF LOGGED & CHECKED 'SAVE METHOD' -> ADD METHOD TO HIS STRIPE LIST
// - IF CHECKED 'MAKE DEFAULT' -> MAKE DEFAULT @STRIPE
