Based on my comprehensive analysis of the codebase and the strict constraints you've outlined, here's the improved checkout experience segmentation:
IMPROVED CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT ANALYSIS
Development Environment Reality Check
Solo Developer Constraints:
Current checkout page has hardcoded data, no real payment processing
Existing Zustand basket store with persistence and comprehensive tests
Address validation API already implemented and tested
Sanity order schema exists but not integrated
No Stripe integration currently implemented
Existing Codebase Dependencies:
Basket store: useBasketStore with basket, getTotal, isCheckoutEnabled
Address validation: Google Maps API integration in AddressForm.tsx
Order schema: Sanity order type with Stripe fields defined
Testing framework: Jest + React Testing Library with established patterns
Workflow Constraints:
Sequential development only (no parallel work)
Each chunk must be completely verified before proceeding
High quality gates with comprehensive testing requirements
Risk Environment Assessment
External Dependencies: Stripe API (highest risk), Google Maps API (medium risk), Sanity CMS (low risk)
Integration Complexity: Payment processing (high), webhook handling (high), state management (medium)
Business Critical Path: Basket → Order Creation → Payment → Confirmation
Failure Impact: Payment failures affect revenue, data integrity critical
PARALLEL WORK IDENTIFICATION
Independent Work Opportunities:
Form validation logic (client-side only)
UI components and styling
Mock implementations for testing
Error handling patterns
Loading state components
Sequential Dependencies:
Payment processing requires order creation
Order creation requires basket integration
Address validation requires form foundation
CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS
Minimum Viable Checkout:
Basket integration (real data display)
Form validation (client-side)
Order creation (Sanity integration)
Payment processing (Stripe integration)
Confirmation flow
Highest Risk Integration Points:
Stripe payment processing (external API, security)
Webhook handling (asynchronous, error-prone)
Order state management (data integrity)

INTEGRATION STRATEGY
State Management Interface:
Apply to CheckoutSpec...
Error Handling Boundaries:
Each chunk has isolated error handling
Graceful degradation if external APIs fail
Clear error messages for users
Data Contracts:
Form data structure defined between chunks
Order data structure matches Sanity schema
Payment data structure matches Stripe requirements
RISK MITIGATION
High-Risk Chunk (Chunk 6) Fallback:
Mock Stripe integration for development
Comprehensive testing with Stripe test mode
Rollback plan to disable payment processing
External API Failures:
Address validation: Fallback to basic form validation
Stripe API: Fallback to order creation without payment
Sanity CMS: Fallback to local order storage
Integration Complexity:
Clear interfaces between chunks
Comprehensive testing at each boundary
Incremental integration testing
VALIDATION FRAMEWORK
✅ No chunk exceeds 20 total hours (max: 18 hours)
✅ No more than 3 chunks in sequential dependency chain
✅ Each chunk has 3+ specific, measurable success criteria
✅ High-risk chunks have explicit fallback strategies
✅ Integration points have defined interfaces
✅ Critical path for minimum viable checkout is identified
✅ Each chunk delivers concrete user or technical value
This segmentation provides a clear, manageable path to implementing a complete checkout experience while respecting all constraints and minimizing risk.
