# Business problem

MAKING MONEY HERE EQUALS:

1. BRAND WHOSE ORDER'S HANDLING IS KNOWN FOR ITS PROFESSIONALISM AND EXCELLENT, POSITIVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.
2. MAJORITY % OF 'ON THE FENCE' ORDERS WITH SOME COMPLICATION, STILL GOT SOLD AND MADE MONEY.
3. ANY BAD ORDER COMPLICATION MINIMIZED POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO BRAND'S REPUTATION VIA PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION/HANDLING.

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN:
Every 10 000 orders === 10 000 customers who:
A) STANDARD "HAPPY" PATH: got order delivered, all items present, exact $ money sum charged, professional e-mail/user account communication happened
B) EXCEPTION "COMPLICATIONS" PATH: got complication resolved fairly, got money back or charge re-balanced depending on order complication, no "exception" went unhandled
C)
