# Payment Security Fix: Saved Payment Method Persistence Issue

## üî¥ Critical Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Saved payment methods were persisting after user logout, potentially showing previous user's payment information to logged-out or new users.

**Root Cause:** Two-fold issue:

1. Stripe Link session data stored in browser localStorage/sessionStorage was not cleared on logout
2. Backend customer ID validation could be more explicit

## ‚úÖ Implemented Solutions

### 1. Backend: Strict Customer ID Validation

**File:** `app/(store)/checkout/payment/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added explicit check: `if (user && user.id)` to ensure user is authenticated
- Added CRITICAL comment explaining that omitting `customer` parameter forces Stripe to treat session as completely new
- Ensures guest checkouts never attach customer ID, preventing any saved payment method display

**Code:**

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Only attach customer ID if user is authenticated AND has valid session
if (user && user.id) {
  // User is logged in - check if they have a Stripe customer ID
  // ... customer logic
} else {
  // Guest checkout: CRITICAL - No customer parameter means no saved payment methods
  // This forces Stripe to treat this as a completely new, unauthenticated session
  data.metadata = {
    orderType: "guest",
  };
}
```

### 2. Frontend: Stripe Link Session Clearing

**File:** `app/components/features/auth/AuthMenu.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Created `handleSignOut()` function that executes before Clerk logout
- Clears all Stripe-related data from localStorage and sessionStorage
- Specifically targets keys starting with "stripe" or containing "Link"
- Maintains error handling to ensure Clerk logout always proceeds

**Code:**

```typescript
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  try {
    // CRITICAL: Clear Stripe Link session data from browser storage
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      // Clear any Stripe-related storage
      Object.keys(localStorage).forEach((key) => {
        if (key.startsWith("stripe") || key.includes("Link")) {
          localStorage.removeItem(key);
        }
      });
      Object.keys(sessionStorage).forEach((key) => {
        if (key.startsWith("stripe") || key.includes("Link")) {
          sessionStorage.removeItem(key);
        }
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error clearing Stripe session:", error);
  } finally {
    // Always sign out from Clerk
    await signOut({ redirectUrl: "/" });
  }
};
```

## üîí Security Benefits

1. **Session Isolation**: Each user session is now properly isolated - saved payment methods only appear when the correct user is authenticated
2. **Browser Storage Hygiene**: Stripe Link session data is purged on logout, preventing session leakage
3. **Defense in Depth**: Both backend (customer ID validation) and frontend (storage clearing) work together
4. **Guest Protection**: Guest users are guaranteed to see a clean checkout without any saved payment methods

## üß™ Testing Checklist

To verify the fix works:

1. **Test Case 1: Logout Clears Payment Methods**
   - [ ] Log in as User A
   - [ ] Go to `/checkout/payment`
   - [ ] Check "Save payment method" and complete a payment
   - [ ] Return to `/checkout/payment` - verify saved method appears
   - [ ] Log out
   - [ ] Return to `/checkout/payment` as guest - verify NO saved methods appear

2. **Test Case 2: Different User Sessions Are Isolated**
   - [ ] Log in as User A, save a payment method
   - [ ] Log out
   - [ ] Log in as User B (different account)
   - [ ] Go to `/checkout/payment` - verify User A's payment methods do NOT appear

3. **Test Case 3: Guest Checkout Remains Clean**
   - [ ] Ensure you're logged out
   - [ ] Go to `/checkout/payment`
   - [ ] Verify NO saved payment methods appear
   - [ ] Complete a payment as guest
   - [ ] Verify payment succeeds without saving

4. **Test Case 4: Re-login Shows Correct Methods**
   - [ ] Log in as User A who has saved methods
   - [ ] Go to `/checkout/payment`
   - [ ] Verify only User A's saved methods appear
   - [ ] Verify default payment method is pre-selected (if set)

## üìù Technical Details

### Why Not Use `stripe.logout()`?

The Stripe JS SDK (`@stripe/stripe-js`) does not expose a `logout()` method. Stripe Link authentication is managed through browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage), so we directly clear the relevant keys.

### localStorage vs sessionStorage

Stripe Link may use either storage mechanism depending on user preferences and browser settings. We clear both to ensure complete session cleanup.

### Backend Safety Net

Even if frontend storage clearing fails, the backend validation ensures that:

- If Clerk reports user as logged out (`!user` or `!user.id`)
- Then `customer` parameter is omitted from PaymentIntent
- Result: Stripe treats it as a new, unauthenticated session

## üö® Critical Notes

1. **Do Not Remove Backend Validation**: The frontend storage clearing is user-controlled (can be bypassed with dev tools). The backend validation is the security boundary.

2. **Clerk Session Must Be Valid**: The `currentUser()` call from Clerk is the source of truth. Never bypass this check.

3. **Stripe Customer ID Must Be Validated**: Even if stored in Clerk metadata, validate it exists and is a string before attaching to PaymentIntent.
